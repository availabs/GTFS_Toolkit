* Currently does NOT HANDLE THE TRANSITION FROM ONE GTFS SCHEDULE TO THE NEXT.

* Reducing redundancy in the spatial data indices can significantly reduce their size.
    The same grouping used the indexing script for memoization should be used when persisting.

* The current naming scheme for subdirectories in the GTFS_Data/ directory
    currently use the first effective date. 
    
    This DOES NOT match how transitfeeds.com handles the dates.

* The Wrapper will need to take the GTFS version as an optional param to handle the transition case,
    and should default to the version currently in use.
    
* Need to implement an admin interface for whatever CRUD operations are needed/wanted.

* Need to implement simple getters for the indices. 
    default to current version, allow specifcation
